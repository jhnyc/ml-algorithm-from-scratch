# ML Algorithms From Scratch
Various popular machine learning algorithms (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, KNN, etc.) built from scratch in Python.

The repo is primarily for learning the inner workings of different algorithms and therefore does not aim to produce the most optimal and efficient implementation of the algorithms.
